# Episode 2
Learnings:-
1. What is npm, npm init?
2. what is package.json, package-lock.json?
3. Installed Parcel !!






 -> npm doesn't stand for Node Package Manager, Instead it stands form evrything other than node package manager , hahaha

-> package.json is configuration for npm ,these are also known as dependencies.
-> npm manages these packages (Think this as similar to pom.xml in mulesoft)

# Bundles:

What is bundle ?
-> A bundle is a single javaScript file which contains all your code + all your dependencies

Why do we need bundles?
--> Browsers can only run JS, HTML, and CSS.In modern projects, you often use:
        Many small JS modules (import … from …)
        External libraries like React, Lodash, etc.
If you load each file separately, it’s slow and messy.
Bundlers like Webpack, Parcel, or Vite combine all your code + libraries into a bundle.js that the browser can run directly.


package.json  -> It’s the manifest file of your project.
                Tells npm/yarn:
                1.What your project is called (name, version, description)
                2.Which dependencies your project uses
                3.Which scripts you can run (npm start, npm run build)


package-lock.json -> This file is auto-generated by npm.
                     It locks the exact versions of dependencies and sub-dependencies.
                     Ensures that if someone else installs your project, they get the exact same versions (no surprises).

node_modules -> It contains actual downloaded ccode for every dependencies and their   sub-dependencies. We dont toch it manualy the npm manages it.
             ->  Every module inside it has seperate package.json , package-lock.json files 
                 this is known as transtive dependency (A->B->C)

what is parcel?
--> It is a javascript bundler , takes all your source files(JS,CSS, images,etc) combines them into a single javascript file.

why do we need parcel? (any other bundlers)
--> In a project there could be many small js modules  like app.js,header,js,footer.js etc . when the browser js tries to run these, it becomes messy and hard to execute on by one .  so we bundle these files .
--> It also does minification and tree shaking to optimize the code 

-->Bundlers evolved over time:
           Webpack → old, powerful, config-heavy
           Parcel → simpler alternative for beginners
           Vite → newest approach, extremely fast for modern frameworks

--> Vite used two diff bundlers 
  1. esbuild -> In dev
  2. rollup  -> In production



There are two types of dependencies 
1. dev dependency ->  used in dev phase
2. normal dependency -> used in production phase

Parcel is a depency which we require in dev phase 
----> npm install -D parcel 
here -D refers to dev dependency
